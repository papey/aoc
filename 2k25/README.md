# 🎄🎅🎄 Advent Of Code, 2K25 edition 🎄🎅🎄

Here is a folder containing all my submissions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).

This time, I'm doing it with [Gleam](https://gleam.run).

## Running the code

Each day has 2 part p1 and p2

```sh
gleam run --module dXX/aoc.gleam
```

Happy Coding !
