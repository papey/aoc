# 🎄🎅🎄 Advent Of Code, 2K19 edition 🎄🎅🎄

Here is a repo containing all my submissions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/).

_Fun concept_, I will loop over 7 languages : Ruby, Crystal, Python, Elixir, Go, Rust & TypeScript. Incrementing loop index by 1, each day.

See related folders for all the solutions ⭐

Cheers !
